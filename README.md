This script automates bid discovery for HLA projects using data scraped daily via Octoparse. It compares newly pulled bids in the "Daily Pull HLA" sheet against previously seen entries in "Seen HLA," flags any new projects, updates both tracking sheets, and generates a formatted email summary. The result is a 90% reduction in manual bid discovery time, streamlining job tracking and ensuring faster awareness of new opportunities.
